# Needle library

This repo contain my implementation of needle, a pytorch-like automatic differentiation library. This package was built as a part of the deep learning systems course at Carnegie Mellon University.

The library includes automatic differentiation, optimization, data loaders, loss functions and modular layers.

Please refer to [Example notebook](https://github.com/noronhaeyan/deep-learning-systems/blob/main/Example%20notebook.ipynb) for implementation details and usage of the needle library.
